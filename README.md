## Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
This repository is for Self-Driving Car Engineer nanodegree Program and Projects.

* Term-1
  * [Project-1: Detect Lane Lines](https://github.com/nr-patel/NP-SDCND/tree/master/NP-SDC-T1-P1-LaneLines) : Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.

  * [Project-2: Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/nr-patel/NP-SDCND/tree/master/NP-SDC-T1-P2-TrafficSignClassifier) : Using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Developed CNN model to classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

  * [Project-3: Behavior Cloning](https://github.com/nr-patel/NP-SDCND/tree/master/NP-SDC-T1-P3-BehavioralCloning) : Using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. Developed training, validation and test model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

  * [Project-4: Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/nr-patel/NP-SDCND/tree/master/NP-SDC-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneFinding) : Applied computer vision techniques to identify lane lines, vehicle position and radius of curvature from a video stream from a forward-facing camera mounted on the front of a vehicle.

  * [Project-5: Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/nr-patel/NP-SDCND/tree/master/NP-SDC-T1-P5-VehicleDetectionTracking) : Created vehicle detection pipeline using Support Vector Classifiers (OpenCV + HOG).
